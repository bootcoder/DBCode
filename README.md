# P10 Build Something Beautiful

##Learning Competencies

  * Building a web application from scratch
  * Managing the development process
  *

##Summary

  You've learned a lot in phase 2: Sinatra, Active Record, Heroku, RSpec, JavaScript, Agile, and much more. Each of these tools is useful in its own right, but together, they give you something much more powerful â€” the ability to build a web application from nothing.

  For this challenge, your assignment is to build something. It can be as practical or trivial as you would want, as long as its a 100% functional, full-stack web application.

##Releases


###Release 0: Decide on What to Build

You can build anything you want, provided that it meets the following requirements:

- It has a database
- It uses an API
- It is styled
- It utilizes JavaScript
- It has meaningful test coverage
- It is deployed

Once you've come up with an idea, get one of your teachers to approve it.

###Release 1: Build it

Once apporoved, start building your project. Be sure to submit a link to where we
can see your site live.
